# Algolia for Salesforce B2C Commerce - PWA Kit Starter Reference Code

This repository provides a starter code for integrating Algolia into your Salesforce Commerce Cloud PWA Kit project. It demonstrates how to incorporate advanced capabilities such as Autocomplete, InstantSearch, and Recommend into your PWA storefronts.

## Overview

The Algolia PWA starter code is based on the [Salesforce Commerce Cloud PWA Kit](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/pwa-kit-overview.html) and leverages Algolia's powerful search and discovery features. It serves as a reference implementation and can be used as a starting point for your own PWA Kit projects.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm 9 or later
- Algolia account

Please note that this starter code is created based on the retail-react-app version 2.3.1. If you are using a different version, some configurations may vary.
